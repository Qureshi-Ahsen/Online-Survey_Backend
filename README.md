This was an backend created for an survey app that was to be used within the organization, I worked on it and my commits are in the feat/response branch.
This project involved creation of database schema's using mongoose models , auth API's using jwt and otp tokens. All crud API's for normal hse of application. 
Unfortunately the project was stopped after this. And was not deployed.
